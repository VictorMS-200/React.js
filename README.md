## First of all

This repository is my fisrt application with React Native. I use CSharp to create a json from the [valorant API](`https://valorant-api.com/`) and use it to data in the web application.

## How to run

First of all, you need to install the dependencies. To do this, run the following command in the my-app folder:

```cmd
npm install
```

After that, you can run the application with the following command:

```cmd
npm start
```
